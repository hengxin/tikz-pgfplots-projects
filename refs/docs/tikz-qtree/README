tikz-qtree 
David Chiang <chiang at isi dot edu>
Version 1.2 (22 Apr 2012)

This package provides a macro for drawing trees with TikZ using the
easy syntax of Alexis Dimitriadis' Qtree. It improves on TikZ's
standard tree-drawing facility by laying out tree nodes without
collisions; it improves on Qtree by adding lots of features from TikZ
(for example, edge labels, arrows between nodes); and it improves on
pst-qtree in being usable with pdfTeX and XeTeX.

Please see tikztree-manual.pdf for instructions and examples.

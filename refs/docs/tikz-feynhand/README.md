The package Tikz-FeynHand https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-feynhand let's you draw Feynman diagrams using TikZ.

It is a low-end modification of the package TikZ-Feynman at https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-feynman,
one of whose principal advantages is the automatic generation of diagrams, for which it needs LuaTex.
FeynHand only provides the manual mode and hence runs in LaTex without any reference to LuaTex.

In addition it provides some NEW STYLES for vertices and propagators, 
alternative SHORTER KEYWORDS in addition to TikZ-Feynman's longer ones, 
some shortcut commands for QUICKLY CUSTOMIZING the diagrams' look,
and the new feature to put one propagator "ON TOP" of another.

It also includes a quick USER GUIDE for getting started,
with many examples and a 5-minute introduction to TikZ.

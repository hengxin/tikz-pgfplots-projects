 tikz-timing
--------------------------------------------------------------

This package provides macros and an environment to generate timing diagrams
(digital waveforms) without much effort.  The TikZ (pgf) package is used to
produce the graphics.  The diagrams may be inserted into text (paragraphs,
\hbox, etc.) and into tikzpictures.  A tabular-like environment is provided to
produce larger timing diagrams.

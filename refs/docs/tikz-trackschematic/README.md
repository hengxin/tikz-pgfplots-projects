# Installation


The tikz library is contained in the files:
* tikz-trackschematic.sty
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.topology.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.trafficcontrol.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.vehicles.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.constructions.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.symbology.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.electrics.code.tex, and
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.measures.code.tex.

These files should be copied wherever TeX can find it, for example in your $TEXMF folder.

Alternatively, the tikz library is provided by CTAN as "[tikz-trackschematic](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-trackschematic)" and is thus part of the TeX Live distribution or can be installed via MiKTeX.

The library can then be loaded through the command
```TeX
\usepackage{tikz-trackschematic}
```
in any LaTeX file.

The library can also be used in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crrxfcdzbhbd).

# Minimal working example

```TeX
\documentclass{standalone} % LaTeX
\usepackage{tikz-trackschematic} % loading the library

\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}

    % TikZ command: specify coordinates
    \coordinate (A)   at (0,0);
    \coordinate (B)   at (6,0);
    \coordinate (T)   at (5,0);

    % draw a track
    \maintrack (A) -- (B);

    % place a train on the track
    \train[forward] at (T) label ();

  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
results in:

![train on a track](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/railtoolkit/tikz-trackschematic/master/doc/examples/minimal_working_example.png "train on a track")

# Symbology and meaning

Please consult the [symbology table](https://github.com/railtoolkit/tikz-trackschematic/blob/master/doc/symbology-table.pdf) for further information regarding meaning of the symbols.

------------

# Roadmap

  * rethink syntax
  * provide option for internationalziation (i18n)
  * rewrite library with better coding skills
  * include support for glossaries package

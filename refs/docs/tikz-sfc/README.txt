Sequential Function Chart (SFC) describes the behaviour of a
control program. It is derived from Petri Nets and GRAFCET.
This package contains a set of symbols that simplifies the
drawing of SFC diagrams with emphasis in readability and in
agreement with the international standard IEC 61 131-3. It
extends the TikZ-library circuits which defines general keys
for creating circuits. All graphic elements of SFC are
supported by tikz-sfc: steps (normal and initial),
transitions, actions and actions qualifiers (with and without
time duration) are supported. The placement of all actions
associated with a step is done automatically. Comments can
also be placed automatically in a suitable location near the
element they refer to. The final appearance of each element
can be fine-tuned individually or in group.

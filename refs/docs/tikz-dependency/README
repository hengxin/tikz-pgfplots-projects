**TikZ-dependency** -- A library to draw dependency graphs
==========================================================

TikZ-dependency allows you to draw dependency graphs with little or
no effort. It also comes with a lot of styling facilities, to let you
personalize the look and feel of the graphs at your liking.

The package has a very easy to learn, high level interface that can be
used to draw simple dependency trees, complex non projective graphs,
bubble parses, and in general any kind of graph which is based on a
sequence of nodes and edges among these.

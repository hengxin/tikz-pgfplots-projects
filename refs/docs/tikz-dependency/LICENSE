Licenses for the TikZ-dependency package
========================================

Different parts of the TikZ-dependency package are distributed
under different licenses:

1. The code of the package (i.e., tikz-dependency.sty) is 
   dual-license. This means that you can decide which license you 
   wish to use when using the TikZ-dependency package. 
   The two options are:

   a) You can use the GNU Public License, version 2.
   b) You can use the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3c.
   
2. The original documentation of the package (i.e., the file 
   tikz-dependency-doc.tex) is also dual-license. Again, you can 
   choose between two options:

   a) You can use the GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.2.
   b) You can use the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3c.

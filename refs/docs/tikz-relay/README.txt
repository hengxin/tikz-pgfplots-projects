This package contains a collection of symbols for typesetting electrical wiring diagrams for relay control systems. The symbols are meant to be in agreement with international standard IEC-60617 which is worldwide adopted with perhaps the exception of USA. It extends and modify, when needed, the TikZ-libray circuits.ee.IEC. A few non-standard symbols are also included mainly to be used in presentations, particularly with beamer package.

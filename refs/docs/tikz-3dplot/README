Description: The tikz-3dplot package provides straightforward ways to define three-dimensional 
coordinate frames through which to plot in TikZ. The user can specify the orientation of the 
main coordinate frame, and use standard TikZ commands and coordinates to render their 
tikzfigure. A secondary coordinate frame is provided to allow rotations and translations with 
respect to the main coordinate frame. In addition, The tikz-3dplot package can also handle 
plotting user-specified functions in spherical polar coordinates, where both the radius and 
fill color can be expressed as parametric functions of polar angles.

Description: The tikz-palattice package allows for drawing a map of a particle accelerator just by
giving a list of elements - similar to lattice files for simulation software. The
package includes 12 common element types like dipoles, quadrupoles, cavities or screens,
as well as automatic labels with element names, a legend, a rule and an environment to
fade out parts of the accelerator. The coordinate of any element can be saved and used
for custom tikz drawings or annotations. Thereby, lattices can be connected to draw
injection/extraction or even a complete accelerator facility.
